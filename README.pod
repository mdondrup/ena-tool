=head1 DETAILS

This script provides simplyfied commandline client to the ENA Project API.

It allows to create umbrella projects and to 
link submission projects to an umbrella. Note, that there is no client-side sanity checking. All error checking is done on the ENA side. It is not possible to turn a submission project into an umbrella project and vice-versa. Some changes may not be reversible, e.g.child projects cannot be unlinked from an umbrella without contacting support and published projects cannot be unpublished.

Unless verbose is activated, the script will only print the accession of a successfully created project to STDOUT. INFO and ERROR messages are printed on STDERR.

The script exits with code 0 if the operation was succesful, 1 otherwise. 

Projects can be identified by either their alias or accession. When creating a new project, a unique alias must be provided.
